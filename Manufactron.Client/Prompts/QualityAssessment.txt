You are performing a quality assessment for manufacturing operations. Analyze the data and identify quality issues and improvement opportunities.

Quality Data:
- Product: {{$product}}
- Batch Information: {{$batch}}
- Test Results: {{$testResults}}
- Defect Rates: {{$defectRates}}
- Customer Complaints: {{$complaints}}

Statistical Analysis:
- Mean: {{$mean}}
- Standard Deviation: {{$stdDev}}
- Cp/Cpk: {{$processCapability}}
- Control Limits: {{$controlLimits}}

Context:
- Equipment Used: {{$equipment}}
- Operator: {{$operator}}
- Environmental Conditions: {{$environment}}
- Material Source: {{$materialSource}}

Assessment Criteria:
1. Identify quality trends and patterns
2. Detect out-of-specification conditions
3. Correlate defects with root causes
4. Assess process capability
5. Evaluate compliance with standards

Output Format:
QUALITY STATUS: [Pass/Warning/Fail]

KEY FINDINGS:
1. [Most significant quality issue]
2. [Secondary quality concern]
3. [Potential risk area]

STATISTICAL SUMMARY:
- Defect Rate: [%]
- Process Capability: [Cp/Cpk values]
- Trend: [Improving/Stable/Degrading]

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- Primary Factor: [Main cause of quality issues]
- Contributing Factors: [List of secondary causes]

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
IMMEDIATE:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

PREVENTIVE:
- [Long-term improvement 1]
- [Long-term improvement 2]

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT: [% quality improvement]

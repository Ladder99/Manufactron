You are optimizing a production schedule. Analyze the current state and provide optimization recommendations.

Current State:
- Production Lines: {{$lines}}
- Active Jobs: {{$jobs}}
- Equipment Status: {{$equipment}}
- Material Availability: {{$materials}}
- Order Priority: {{$orders}}

Constraints:
- Available Hours: {{$availableHours}}
- Changeover Times: {{$changeoverTimes}}
- Quality Requirements: {{$qualityRequirements}}
- Maintenance Windows: {{$maintenanceWindows}}

Optimization Goals:
1. Maximize OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)
2. Minimize changeover time
3. Meet delivery deadlines
4. Balance workload across lines
5. Reduce waste and rework

Analysis Steps:
1. Identify bottlenecks in current schedule
2. Calculate optimal job sequencing
3. Determine best line assignments
4. Account for maintenance requirements
5. Buffer for potential disruptions

Output Format:
OPTIMIZED SCHEDULE:
[Time] | [Line] | [Job] | [Product] | [Quantity] | [Duration]

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
- OEE Improvement: [%]
- Changeover Reduction: [hours]
- Delivery Performance: [%]

CRITICAL PATH:
[List critical operations that cannot be delayed]

RISK MITIGATION:
[Identify and address potential risks]

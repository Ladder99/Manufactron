# Manufactron Project Overview

## Purpose
A manufacturing agentic framework built with .NET and Semantic Kernel to create an intelligent system for autonomous monitoring, analysis, and optimization of manufacturing processes.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: C# (.NET 9.0)
- **Framework**: .NET SDK
- **AI/ML**: Microsoft Semantic Kernel (to be integrated)
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI (to be integrated)
- **Project Type**: Console Application (currently basic template)

## Current State
The project is currently a basic .NET 9.0 console application template with minimal structure. It needs to be built out with:
- Semantic Kernel integration
- OpenAI connectivity
- Manufacturing domain plugins
- Agent orchestration system
- Memory and planning capabilities

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows
- **IDE**: Visual Studio / JetBrains Rider (based on .idea folder presence)
- **Build System**: MSBuild (.csproj)
